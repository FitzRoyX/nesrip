## About

This tool extracts graphics from NES roms into modern PNG tilesheets. It has drag-n-drop and command-line functionality. The database, when completed, will effectively document every game's graphics locations, bitplane type, pattern type, compression type, and palettes. It has powerful features like a colorizer and tile deduplicator. Future map and sprite definition tools using these modernized sheets are planned.

## Supported compilers
* [TCC](https://github.com/TinyCC/tinycc)
* [GCC](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)
* [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make)

## Building and usage

The easiest way to build this tool on Windows is by using TCC (TinyCC), a super small compiler with no installer. A prebuilt version can be found [here](https://github.com/FitzRoyX/tinycc/releases/tag/tcc_20251005). Simply extract it into the nesrip folder so that nesrip/tcc/tcc.exe exists, then run "compile_with_tcc_local.bat". This will create nesrip.exe, onto which roms can be dragged to create PNG output files. A game must be in the database for the tool to work. The database is a text file called nes_gfx_db.txt.

## Graphics database commands
```
//trailing and inline comments are supported
hash {}
c {} (compression type)
b {1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8} (bitplane type)
p {1/2/4/8/16} {h/v} (pattern size and direction)
r {true/false} (tile deduplicator)
k (clear tile deduplicator cache)
s {} {} (section start and end)
end
```

## Command-Line usage
```
nesrip.exe filename
```

## Compression types

* `raw`: Uncompressed graphics

## Version History
